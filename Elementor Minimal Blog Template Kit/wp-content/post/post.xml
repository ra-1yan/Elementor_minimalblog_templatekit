<p><strong>Jimmy Donaldson, the 23-year-old American better known as MrBeast, was YouTube's highest-earning content creator in 2021, according to Forbes.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His elaborate stunts have generated more than 10 billion views on the platform and earned him $54m (£39m).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He has overtaken 10-year-old toy reviewer Ryan Kaji, who has topped the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2022/01/14/the-highest-paid-youtube-stars-mrbeast-jake-paul-and-markiplier-score-massive-paydays/?sh=4018392c1aa7">annual list</a>&nbsp;for the past two years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Together, the 10 best-paid YouTubers made a combined $300m (£218m) in 2021, the US magazine estimated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jake Paul is in second place, his first appearance in the top 10 since 2018, and his brother Logan also returns after being absent since 2017.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Minecraft player Nathan Graham, known as Unspeakable, makes the list for the first time in fifth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>YouTube trends expert Chris Stokel-Walker said this year's list is interesting because it shows "how stale" YouTube has become. "It strikes me how white and male this whole list is," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"If you take any of the names and look at previous years' lists, you'll probably find them on there as well, just in a different order."</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2 id="subheadline-10">Boom time</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the pandemic, lots of traditional entertainment media had a difficult time adjusting. Movies were delayed, soap opera schedules were altered and video game releases were postponed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For YouTube, however, it was a time of boom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Research suggests that in 2021, the platform had 2.3 billion users worldwide. YouTube says one billion hours of video content is consumed on the platform every day.</p>

<p><strong>Jimmy Donaldson, the 23-year-old American better known as MrBeast, was YouTube's highest-earning content creator in 2021, according to Forbes.</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>His elaborate stunts have generated more than 10 billion views on the platform and earned him $54m (£39m).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He has overtaken 10-year-old toy reviewer Ryan Kaji, who has topped the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/abrambrown/2022/01/14/the-highest-paid-youtube-stars-mrbeast-jake-paul-and-markiplier-score-massive-paydays/?sh=4018392c1aa7">annual list</a>&nbsp;for the past two years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Together, the 10 best-paid YouTubers made a combined $300m (£218m) in 2021, the US magazine estimated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Jake Paul is in second place, his first appearance in the top 10 since 2018, and his brother Logan also returns after being absent since 2017.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Minecraft player Nathan Graham, known as Unspeakable, makes the list for the first time in fifth place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>YouTube trends expert Chris Stokel-Walker said this year's list is interesting because it shows "how stale" YouTube has become. "It strikes me how white and male this whole list is," he said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>"If you take any of the names and look at previous years' lists, you'll probably find them on there as well, just in a different order."</p>

<h2 id="subheadline-10">Boom time</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the pandemic, lots of traditional entertainment media had a difficult time adjusting. Movies were delayed, soap opera schedules were altered and video game releases were postponed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For YouTube, however, it was a time of boom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Research suggests that in 2021, the platform had 2.3 billion users worldwide. YouTube says one billion hours of video content is consumed on the platform every day.</p>
